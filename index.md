## Selected projects in Data Engineering

### Krello Data Engineering on Azure

Developed end-to-end data integration solutions using **Azure PostgreSQL**, **Azure Data Factory**, and **Snowflake**, seamlessly transferring private dev data from Krello (a startup I co-founded). Implemented **ETL pipelines** for PostgreSQL to Snowflake, **orchestrated web scraping workflows with Apache Airflow**, and automated data lake-to-warehouse integration. 


*The databricks part has not been implemented yet.

``` Azure, Azure Data Factory, Azure Database for PostgreSQL,  Snowflake, Apache Airflow, Databricks, SQL, Spark, ETL/ELT, Batch Jobs ```

### Zindi New User Engagement Prediction Challenge

The objective of this challenge is to predict if a new user from a selected cohort will engage with Zindi in their second month on the platform. For example, if a user joined in June, will they be active in July? 

I have proposed a model based on a **deep auto-encoder and a classification network trained jointly** to learn the features that are important to model, then use them for the classification.

##### Ranked 5/212 !

### Cain’s Jawbone Murder Mystery

My job, as the puzzle solver, was to try to put 75 pages of the famous Cain’s Jawbone into its correct order, using AI NLP algorithms.

I have used **BERT NextSentence prediction (NSP) from Hugging Face** along with cosine similarity to order the pages.
