### Zindi New User Engagement Prediction Challenge

The objective of this challenge is to predict if a new user from a selected cohort will engage with Zindi in their second month on the platform. For example, if a user joined in June, will they be active in July? 

I have proposed a model based on a **deep auto-encoder and a classification network trained jointly** to learn the features that are important to model, then use them for the classification.

##### Ranked 5/212 !
